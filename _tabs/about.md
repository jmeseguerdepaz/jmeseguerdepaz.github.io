I am a software engineer specialized in computational physics and computer graphics. I am extremely lucky to be working on these areas (specially in the former) as the current LiquiGen lead in [JangaFX](https://jangafx.com/). LiquiGen is a real-time liquid solver for VFX. Previously, I worked on the visualization side of the LBM-based CFD [Simulia XFLOW](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/products/xflow/). For more details, you can check my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/javier-meseguer-de-paz/).

I have implemented several fluid solvers ranging from volumetric solvers (SPH, PIC/FLIP, PBF, LBM, MPM) and heighfield-based solvers (FV NSWE, BTE, spectrum-based). Nevertheless, there is a never-ending stream of new research when it comes to this area, so the fun is far from over! If you like this stuff and would like to talk about it, don't hesitate to drop me a line!

As far as the outside world goes, I enjoy hiking, [night photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jmeseguerdepaz/]), escape rooms, and basically any outside activity. I also watch absurd amounts of educational YouTube videos...
